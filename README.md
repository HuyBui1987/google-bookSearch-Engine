# Project: Google-booksearch-engine
## Description

This project is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

It takes the starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactors it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was initially built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
